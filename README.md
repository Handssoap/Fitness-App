> # Latte's Fitness App

Although many fitness apps are available, we, along with many others, feel that none truly cater to our unique health goals in a personalized and effective way. That's why we decided to create an app that acts like a personal fitness trainer, designed to tailor a program specifically for each user.

Our app not only creates personalized workout plans based on the user's goals but also adapts and evolves with the userâ€™s progress. By leveraging AI-driven recommendations and advanced progress tracking, we ensure that each program is as dynamic and flexible as a real trainer would be. Additionally, our app fosters a sense of community, offering support and motivation through shared goals and challenges.

With this, we aim to help users reach their desired physical goal while providing a personalized, ever-evolving experience that supports them throughout their fitness journey.

## Contribution:

We do not use git flow. However, new features are branched and named according to the feature. Any bugs will be brought up with GitHub issues. Before merging with the main branch, a pull request is made and reviewed by one or more team members.

## Sample Demo of the Project

A demonstration of our app's current implementation is shown in this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kBpB9okgABVoCC0CJaDd88qlTYrVZhDq/view?usp=sharing

Side note: unsubscribed from zylalabs api so the ai workout generator is no longer functional.
